While many of its neighbors in the Middle East and North Africa have witnessed violent coups and military invasions, Tunisia has had surprising success following the overthrow of its former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. In 2018, Freedom House rated Tunisia as "free"—the only country in the region to receive such a rating. The country has held multiple elections and seen peaceful transitions of executive and parliamentary power. Tunisia has also seen ambitious regulatory and legal reforms, as government functions that had previously been monopolized by the Ben Ali regime have been devolved to local authorities.[^1] Importantly, respect for human rights has increased, with greater allowance for freedom of expression, religion, and thought.[^2] 

One of the many keys to Tunisia's post-revolutionary success has been its expansion of civic space. In September 2011, the interim government passed Decree 88 of 2011, which reversed decades of highly restricted civil society regulations, strengthened the country's domestic civil society sector, and opened the door for substantial advocacy by international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). In the years that followed, Tunisia became a regional hub for civil society advocacy. In January 2014, a coalition of NGOs and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) launched Jamaity.org, an online portal dedicated to sharing information about the country's burgeoning civil society sector, with links to information about NGO projects, regulatory initiatives, upcoming events, and a database of all international and domestic NGOs working in the country. Later that year, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS)—an NGO that had worked in Egypt since 1993 as a think tank, research center, and hub for human rights advocacy for the broader Middle East—moved its regional and international operations to Tunisia following its expulsion from Egypt.[^3] In addition, the expansion of civic space allowed international NGOs to influence domestic policy. In 2014, Article 19—an international freedom of expression advocacy NGO—helped enshrine strong expression and associational rights in the country's new constitution.

The success of domestic and international NGOs in Tunisia stands in contrast to broader trends of restricted civic space throughout the world. Legal crackdowns and repressive regulations for NGOs and other civil society organizations have increased substantially since 2000, despite international efforts to expand civic space around the world and stem the tide of anti-NGO regulations, the legal environment for civil society organizations has become increasingly restricted. Dozens of authoritarian countries have passed harsh new anti-NGO laws, including Russia, Egypt, China, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. In 2017, CIVICUS reported that only 3% of the world's population lives in countries that impose minimal restrictions on associational activity [@CIVICUS:2017; @Heiss:2019], while most face obstructed or repressed civic space (see @fig:civicus-map).[^4] 

Tunisia's open civil society regulatory environment paved the way for the success of advocacy NGOs and helped shape its domestic policy and constitutional law. The country's favorable institutional context was essential for the success of international advocacy NGOs, but importantly, it is not the only ingredient. International advocacy NGOs working in more restrictive host countries have also had success in influencing policy and safeguarding human rights in the face of closing civic space. How does a country's regulatory environment for NGOs influence the effectiveness of international advocacy organizations? What internal traits and strategies enable organizations to be successful in constrained institutional contexts?

In this article, I explore the interaction between interest group characteristics, preferences, aims, and strategies and the domestic political opportunity structures of the countries these groups work in. As @DellmuthBloodgood:2018 explain in the introduction to this issue, institutional context has long been central to explaining organizational strategic adaptation in the interest group literatures. The institutions that organizations face help define the political access and practical strategies available to advocacy organizations. Research on international NGOs, on the other hand, has assumed a naturally confrontational relationship between organizations and states and has instead tended to look at how the internal characteristics of INGOs [@Wong:2012] or the links and relationships between INGOs [@Carpenter:2014] enable these organizations to be effective in global governance [@HeissJohnson:2016]. 

Importantly, this inherent conflict is exacerbated by the fact that international NGOs are *international* and can rely on connections with their home countries to boomerang and spiral around institutional obstacles they face in their target countries [@KeckSikkink:1998; @RisseSikkink:1999]. When host-country regulatory environments constrict, when recalcitrant governments expel their staff, or when domestic partner NGOs are closed down, international NGOs can turn to their home governments to exert pressure on offending governments. Accordingly, the institutional environment of INGO host countries has received much less attention in the international relations literature—the boomerang and spiral models of international advocacy allow us to assume away many of these institutional constraints. When international relations research does address institutional contexts, it tends to do so in a way that makes INGOs a victim of restrictions, helpless to resist or counter government intrusion into their advocacy [@Teets:2014]. 

Below, I bridge research in international relations and nonprofit management/interest group dynamics to examine how internal organizational characteristics allow INGOs to successfully navigate—and even manipulate—the institutional constraints they face. I first examine how internal and institutional factors influence international NGO behavior and then explore a growing field of research that shows how NGOs have begun to move beyond the victim narrative and take control of their regulatory environments. I then propose my primary hypothesis: internal programmatic flexibility permits international advocacy NGOs to most effectively respond to changes in their institutional environments. I test this hypothesis with an extended case study of Article 19, showing how organizations with the most programmatic flexibility are the most successful at both navigating strict regulations and shaping domestic policy in their host countries. I conclude by addressing the central theoretical argument of this issue, discussing how the interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments shape and constrain the effects of interest groups in global governance.


# Internal and institutional determinants of INGO behavior

Nonprofit organizational culture and internal structures are core determinants of INGO behavior. The preferences and ideals of an organization's managers, employees, and volunteers shape an organization's stated mission, vision, and values and can influence the organization's success and efficiency. Substantial research on nonprofit management looks precisely at how organizations can optimize their managerial structure [@Brown:2010; @HermanRenz:2004], improve relationships with their boards [@Renz:2004; @Renz:2010a], effectively and ethically manage donations from individuals, corporations, governments, and foundations [@Young:2010; @Smith:2006; @Kerlin:2006], train employees and volunteers [@WatsonAbzug:2010], and clearly articulate their vision through a well-crafted mission statement [@Sheehan:1996]. These internal traits of NGOs influence the success of their programming. For instance, @Wong:2012 shows that INGOs can centralize or decentralize different forms of managerial power: the power to propose new goals and missions, the power to enforce those goals, and the power to actually implement those proposals. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power while decentralizing implementation power are better able to pursue a central agenda without stifling local creativity, thus leading to better success [@Wong:2012]. Organizations that fail to follow these best practices, adhering to well-defined missions, maintaining consistent funding streams, or properly centralizing and decentralizing decision making authority, are more likely to struggle, especially under restrictive regulations. 

INGO strategies are also shaped by the political structures and institutions they interact with [@HeissJohnson:2016; @GugertyPrakash:2010; @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. INGOs are products of the legal regulations, historical precedents, political trends, and cultural norms of both their home countries and the countries they target, all of which define the boundaries for INGO operations. In contrast with internal NGO traits and interactions with other actors, the effect of the institutional environment on international NGOs is relatively understudied [@BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. @Stroup:2012 shows that the organizational structures and missions of INGOs are deeply tied to the cultural and legal environments of their home countries. For example, she argues that CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. Additionally, because Amnesty International refuses government funding (in part because of the historical absence of government funding for charities), it focuses much of its advocacy work on British and American human rights abuses. Newer work has turned to the influences of host country institutions on INGOs. @Chaudhry:2016 finds that states violently crack down on foreign NGOs when they pose an immediate threat to political stability, and I find that these restrictions tend to follow periods of civil unrest, political unrest within the ruling regime, and coups and violent protests in neighboring countries [@Heiss:2017]. NGOs working in authoritarian regimes remain aware of political trends in their countries and make programmatic and strategic adjustments in order to maintain their access to the country and avoid authoritarian co-optation of their programs.

## Adverse effects stemming from the interaction of internal and institutional characteristics

The interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments can create inefficiencies in nonprofit programming. For instance, NGOs often change their behavior to obtain funding from governments and private donors. Government grants can crowd out and replace private donations [@KimVan-Ryzin:2014] and their strict reporting requirements can shift nonprofit priorities towards bureaucratic compliance and away from their core missions [@Suarez:2011; @Bush:2015]. Additionally, nonprofits are highly responsive to shifting donor demands and can modify their stated missions in pursuit of consistent funding streams [@AbouAssi:2013; @AbouAssiTschirhart:2017]. Programmatic and strategic demands from donors can lead to suboptimal outcomes. For instance, government grant requirements often insist that applicant organizations pursue specific behaviors, such as collaboration with other organizations, even if collaboration is not the optimal strategy for the organization. In fact, because of this push for collaboration, regardless of its consequences, one of the best predictors of a nonprofit organization receiving government funding is whether or not it collaborates with other nonprofits [@Suarez:2011]. As these organizations create inefficient collaborative networks, organizational objectives and missions are often dropped or discarded in pursuit of additional funding, resulting in a market failure [@WitesmanHeiss:2016]. These inefficiencies are directly tied to the structural incentives to collaborate, pushing organizations to adopt suboptimal strategies in the interest of securing funding. 

Government regulations are also often specifically designed to cause these inefficiencies. Repressive governments have an incentive to limit the foreign influence of guest INGOs and mitigate their potential political risks However, because international NGOs are incorporated and managed by the laws of other countries, it is more difficult to directly regulate non-domestic organizations. Attempts to control INGO activities within the host country can incur opposition from foreign countries, international organizations, and other larger international NGOs—too much regulation can trigger a boomerang effect and draw out support. To counter this, governments can mitigate the risks of contentious international NGOs by employing regulations designed both to filter out organizations before they enter the country and limit the scope of their activities once they do establish operations. These gatekeeping laws are designed to create a less inviting, less tolerant institutional environment for international advocacy and make life more difficult for INGOs, introducing barriers to registration and adding obstacles to effectively undertaking their missions. 


# Article 19

I theorize that INGOs with greater flexibility—that is, organizations that are larger, better funded, that collaborate with other organizations, and have close relationships with local government officials—will be best positioned to adapt to changing regulations. Programmatic flexibility is especially important for organizations with missions that directly challenge the preferences of their host governments, such as those advocating for greater respect for human rights and civil liberties. The experiences of Article 19 illustrate this phenomenon well.

## Mission and strategy

Article 19 was founded in 1987 by the children of American businessman and philanthropist J. Roderick MacArthur, who himself was the son of John MacArthur, a famous American philanthropist whose endowment established the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The younger philanthropist was a champion of civil rights who "believed that foundations should be at the cutting edge of social change" [@Nielsen:1996, 132]. Before his death in 1984, he laid out his vision to establish an international organization to combat censorship [@Fein:1992]. Though he died before the organization was incorporated, his children provided a $500,000 seed grant and founded what has become one of the world's most prominent freedom of expression NGOs.

The organization takes its name from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes that

> [e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers [@udhr:1948, art. XIX].

In its 30 years of advocacy work, Article 19 has been motivated by a clear vision, working toward a world "where people are free to speak their opinions, to participate in decision-making, and to make informed choices about their lives."[^5] The practical contours of this vision have evolved over time. In its early years, Article 19 litigated and lobbied for imprisoned journalists, but over time has expanded its mission to encompass advocacy for all speech and information. Today, its stated mission is to "work so that people everywhere can express themselves freely, access information and enjoy freedom of the press."[^6] The organization has a wide-ranging portfolio of programs that cover each of the three pillars of its core mission. First, a substantial portion of Article 19's attention is focused on protecting *individual expression*. The organization publishes research papers, issues statements, and releases advocacy letters that call on governments to maintain assembly and speech rights and discourage repressive regimes from passing laws to abrogate those rights. Article 19 also gets involved directly with litigation and lobbying, working with local lawyers to defend the rights of people imprisoned for self-expression and advising politicians and bureaucrats as they draft new laws to regulate expression. Second, the organization is concerned with ensuring *access to information*. Article 19 consults governments and lobbies for Right to Information (RTI) laws that guarantee access to public information and promote government transparency and accountability. The organization also advocates for progressive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) laws that guarantee access to the internet. Finally, Article 19 focuses on maintaining and promoting *freedom of the press*, again lobbying and consulting governments as they draft media laws, advocating for minimal press regulation, and shaming regimes that engage in violence against the press. The organization has had substantial success, setting international standards for freedom of expression and working directly with dozens of countries to establish and reform domestic laws regarding speech, assembly, and expression [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 32].

## Sources of programmatic flexibility

As discussed above, repressive governments employ gatekeeping regulations to keep contentious INGOs outside of their countries or severely limit their activities within their countries. Article 19 has been successful in creatively adapting to the gatekeeping restrictions in the dozens of countries it targets because of its many sources of programmatic flexibility, including reliable donors with deep pockets, regional offices located in stable countries near more repressive target countries, and dozens of professionalized staff with close connections to the government officials and bureaucrats best positioned to support freedom of expression-based legislative reform. 

### Steady revenue

Since its initial $500,000 grant from the J. Roderick MacArthur foundation, Article 19 has enjoyed a relatively steady flow of revenue. Though it accepts individual donations, the bulk of Article 19's funding comes from governments and large organizations. Roughly half of its income comes from various British government agencies [@Stroup:2012, 180], including the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the UK's Department for International Aid (DFID), and British embassies. The remainder comes from other foreign governments—primarily Sweden and Norway—intergovernmental organizations like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Commission, and large American foundations and nonprofits such as the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the Ford Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Article 19 has been able to maintain a relatively steady flow of revenue over time, shifting and seeking out new grants as needed. For instance, after 2004, funding from the Open Society Foundations dried up, but the organization was able to replace it with grants from the Ford Foundation [@Stroup:2012, 180]. In general, the organization has maintained a balanced or surplus budget, which has allowed it to expand its operations to a global scale (see top panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff).

![Article 19's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](output/a19-budget-staff){#fig:a19-budget-staff}

### Donor alignment

More importantly than steady revenue, however, is the alignment of Article 19's vision with that of its donors. To avoid mission drift, the organization seeks out foundations that already have a history of funding freedom of expression and anti-censorship work, such as OSF and the Ford Foundation. Article 19 consults with its donors to ensure that their visions and missions align. This is particularly important for the type of legislative advocacy Article 19 engages in—lobbying is expensive, time consuming, and runs a high risk of failure, even in democratic target countries. Article 19 staffers noted that foundations looking for guaranteed quick returns on their social investments can lack the patience and flexibility to fund the organization's lobbying efforts. One compared the slowness of their work with the Polish Solidarity movement in the 1980s, which received funds from Western donors while making little visible progress in promoting human rights until the fall of communist rule in Poland. The staffer observed that Solidarity would not have existed had donors thought about the movement like they do today, with donor emphasis on results-based outcomes.[^7] Evidence from @Bush:2015 supports this view, showing that donors' increasing emphasis on professionalization and measurable results has led to a taming of confrontational democracy assistance programs. Accordingly, Article 19 seeks out donors with longer time horizons and more permissive standards of results to ensure that their programs are not tamed by donor demands.

### Global reach

Another key source of flexibility is Article 19's geographic proximity to the countries it targets. Since at least the early 2000s, Article 19 has divided its advocacy work primarily by region, assigning staff to portfolios of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa,[^8] each overseen by an expert program officer. The organization also maintains issue-specific programs focused on law, operations, and digital advocacy,[^9] covering its work across all regions. Prior to 2005, beyond a few small regional offices in Latin America, most of Article 19's staff were based in London, with program officers traveling regularly to their assigned regions and communicating with implementing partners remotely. In 2004, under the direction of executive director Agnès Callamard, the organization established a 5-year strategic vision that included a goal to strengthen Article 19's global presence, starting by exploring options for creating permanent local offices in each region [@a19:2005, 41]. By 2007, that goal had crystalized into a more specific target of establishing "a presence in all five regions by 2010, including through posting of staff, opening of local/regional offices, and/or institutionalised partnership (franchise) with local NGOs" [@a19:2007, 18]. 

![Article 19's headquarters and regional offices](output/a19-offices){#fig:a19-offices}

Between 2007–08, Article 19 established four regional offices in Kenya, Mexico, Brazil, and Bangladesh. Regional offices were later established in Senegal and Tunisia, and the organization today has a nearly global reach (see @fig:a19-offices). Each local Article 19 office is governed by its own local board of directors that is charged with implementing the programs organized and proposed by the central London office. Article 19's regional offices are less independent than the country-based affiliates of other human rights advocacy organizations like Amnesty International, whose country offices have enormous implementation power and strategic latitude [@Wong:2012]. Article 19's organizational strategy is coordinated and overseen in London by its executive director and senior management team [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 30] and supported by a core of roughly 20–30 permanent staff members.

![Expenditures as percent of total](output/a19-regions-expenses-pct){#fig:a19-regions-expenses-pct}

Article 19's expenditures by region, 2011–15
</div>

Beginning in 2013, under the leadership of its new executive director Thomas Hughes, Article 19's focus became substantially more global. The organization had previously spent the majority of its programming expenses on programs in Africa, with a peak in 2013 of nearly £1,000,000 (see @fig:a19-regions-expenses-abs). Since then, however, African spending has been reduced while programs in other regions have seen increased funding. Looking at the percent of money spent on regional programs highlights this shift more clearly. African programs had consistently accounted for roughly a third of all regional expenditures until the organization's global turn in 2013–14. By 2015, all regions received between 12 and 22 percent of the organization's expenses, with no clear outliers (see @fig:a19-regions-expenses-pct). Article 19's focus on global advocacy was made possible because of its network of regional and national offices. In conjunction with the normalization of its regional focus, Article 19 expanded its staff substantially between 2011–2013, quadrupling the number of full time employees (see bottom panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff) and spreading its new staff to its regional offices. More staff and regional experts deployed in national offices gives the organization increased access to government officials, enhances their ability to lobby governments, and allows them to stay abreast of regulatory changes. Article 19 systematically reanalyzes the legal environment of its host countries every few years and relies on its country experts to understand how changes in the practical operating environment might influence its ability to continue to engage in advocacy.[^10] 

### Collaboration

A final source of Article 19's programmatic flexibility is its close collaborative relationships with more than 90 different governments, IGOs, and INGOs.[^11] In addition to working closely with the British, Norwegian, and Swedish governments (who are its largest governmental funders), Article 19 was a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of advocacy NGOs created in 1992 [@Sharpe:2000, 46]. Today, IFEX boasts more than 100 organizational members, including prominent human rights organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders, and PEN International.[^12] Participation in issue networks like IFEX boosts Article 19's lobbying and litigation capacity and grants it access to countries and resources that are closed off due to gatekeeping regulations.

## Drawing on programmatic flexibility to maintain access to restrictive countries

Restrictions on individual freedom of expression have increased in concert with restrictions in civic space and associational life—authoritarian states are increasingly cracking down on both speech and civil society. While Article 19 is primarily concerned with maintaining freedom of expression, it must also confront the more restrictive legal operating environments in the countries it works in. The organization recognizes this, noting that "civic space isn't closing—it's closed."[^13] In the past few years, Article 19 has become more conscious about maintaining access to repressive target countries. Its 2014 annual report, entitled "Protecting Civic Space," not only outlined the organization's legislative and advocacy accomplishments from the previous year, but explained how more restrictive anti-NGO legislation had made it more difficult to engage in their work. Paddy Coulter, chairman of the organization, observed that "2014 was a year of growth for us: growth in the threats to information and media freedoms around the world but also in our capacity to respond" [@a19:2014, 3]. This willingness and "capacity to respond"—or flexibility—has allowed Article 19 to creatively adapt to increasingly burdensome regulations over the past decade. In particular, the organization has drawn on its programmatic flexibility to respond to registration and entry restrictions, security threats, and limits on their programs. Importantly, its funding structure, collaboration with domestic officials, and global reach have allowed it to take control of regulations in post-revolutionary Tunisia.

### Responding to registration restrictions

On its face, moving strategic planning and implementation away from the organization's central offices in London was designed to enhance the organization's access to remote partners, allowing it to "respond more swiftly to opportunities or crises, … be closer to [its] partners, work more closely with them, and thus be more capable to respond to their demands and strengthen interactions and capacities" [@a19:2008, 38]. Beyond enhancing the organization's programmatic efficiency by moving its experts to the field, decentralization also provided legal and regulatory benefits and allowed Article 19's central offices to better handle the complexities of each country's registration regulations. These offices were formally registered according to each country's foreign NGO regulations, and to smooth the registration process, each office was established as part of projects funded by large donors. Article 19 Mexico, for example, was created in 2008 as part of a Right to Information (RTI) advocacy campaign funded by the Hewlett Foundation—its local registration was incidental to the overall program. The other regional offices followed a similar pattern: Article 19 Brazil and Article 19 Bangladesh were both incorporated in 2008 while implementing RTI programs funded by DFID, while Article 19 Kenya was registered in 2007 to undertake a project in Sudan funded by the European Commission and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [@a19:2008, 38]. Article 19 collaborated with its funders to overcome and avoid registration hurdles. Not only did bundling the registration of its regional offices with larger grants sponsored by governmental aid agencies like DFID and the European Commission expedite the registration process in each country, linking registration to grant fulfillment imbued Article 19's regional offices and programs with international backing and legitimacy.

### Responding to entry restrictions

Article 19 further ensured the success of their remote registration status by strategically selecting countries with the most amenable and navigable civil society regulatory environments, essentially choosing the "best house in a bad neighborhood" [@BarryBellClay:2015]. As mentioned previously, Article 19 reanalyzes legal trends in its various host countries to ensure that its mission aligns with the regulatory environments of its various target countries. Gatekeeping regulations factor into their decisions to expand to other countries. In the past decade, the organization has considered establishing a more formal presence in countries like Egypt and China, but concluded that the regulatory environments for INGOs in these countries would require too much effort and too many legal resources to keep any offices open.[^14]

When deciding where to expand its regional offices, Article 19 selects countries where it can have the most impact—both in-country and throughout the region—with the least amount of government interference. Brazil, Bangladesh, Mexico, Kenya, Senegal, and Tunisia each have more relaxed and friendlier laws than their regional neighbors. Registering as an international NGO in India, Ethiopia, Sudan, or Egypt, for instance, is more expensive, complicated, and risky than working from Bangladesh, Kenya, or Tunisia. The organization formally registered its office in Tunisia in 2011 precisely because it was the "safe option."[^15] Because post-revolutionary laws regarding NGO registration were more open than any other country in the region, Tunis became a safe central home base for Article 19's Middle Eastern work. 

Article 19 can afford to be selective in where it places its regional offices because of its large budget and international flexibility. Since it already has an established headquarters in London, it can take time to deliberate and debate possible regional offices. With consistent revenue, it can take more risks as it expands its programs. The Tunis office was formally incorporated in 2011, but as explained below, Article 19 has been active in Tunisia since at least 2004. Rather than establish regional offices from scratch, the organization builds on existing work and connections. Additionally, because it has multiple programs spread across the world, the organization can close and relocate its offices more easily. In the 1990s, prior to the organization's official policy of decentralization, it incorporated Article 19 South Africa as a regional subsidiary organization. Rising operational costs and increasing difficulties with coordination led to the office's closure in 2004 [@Stroup:2012, 180; @a19-fin:2004], but leaving the country did not have an overly negative effect on Article 19's programs in the region. From its base in London, the organization continued to hold workshops, lobby politicians, consult bureaucrats, and litigate against censorship throughout the region in 2004 [@a19:2004; @a19:2005]. While it has not yet been forced out of any of its current regional offices because of gatekeeping regulations, past experience shows that Article 19 would likely be able to absorb and adapt to such a change because of its flexibility, shifting resources and staff around to different regional or home offices.

### Responding to security threats

In its 2014 annual report, dedicated to closing civic space, Article 19 noted that programming restrictions—particularly legal and security threats against in-country staff—were one of the most urgent challenges to undertaking its mission. Executive director Thomas Hughes observed, "Unfortunately, 2014 was marked by a deteriorating security environment for us and our partners. Threats against staff increased, mirroring the global trend of greater suppression and restriction of individuals and institutions defending human rights" [@a19:2014, 4]. 

Article 19 has responded to rising security threats by increasing its spending on security services, hiring and contracting additional guards, translators, fixers, and support staff. This additional security support has allowed the organization to continue its work in its various target countries, but it has imposed significant costs and increased expenditures by roughly 10%.[^16] For instance, in 2014 one staff member was detained in Ethiopia on his way to conduct a safety training workshop. Immigration officials confiscated his passport and phone and denied him access to legal advice [@a19:2014, 15]. In response, Article 19 had to unexpectedly increase its Ethiopian advocacy, lobbying against the government both for imprisoned journalists and bloggers and for the safety and continued access of program staff in the country. Similarly, following the passage of a new anti-terrorism and national security law in Kenya that granted the government the ability to arbitrarily reexamine or cancel the registrations of civil society organizations,[^17] Article 19 increased both its security spending and its litigation against the regime, responses made possible by the organization's reliable access to revenue and its professional legal staff. 

### Responding to programmatic restrictions

In many of its target countries, laws and regulations prohibit Article 19 from engaging in different forms of advocacy. The organization has a diverse menu of possible advocacy activities, and it selects which programs to offer based on both the needs and the practical operating environment of the target country. Because Article 19 works in dozens of different countries and engages in a wide variety of forms of advocacy, it can match its programming to its host legal environment, continue its mission, and maintain some level of access to the country without fundamentally changing its vision or values.

For instance, Article 19 faces intense opposition to its pro-speech litigation in countries with strict blasphemy laws. In Sudan in 2008, the organization created the Khartoum Advocacy Centre Blog and worked with local lawyers to advocate on behalf of a journalist imprisoned on charges of blasphemy. However, in 2009, following government hostility and threats, Article 19 closed down the blog and helped its local partners leave the country [@a19:2009, 7]. The organization adopted a "new strategy of interventions" targeted at Sudan and has continued its advocacy efforts from exile, criticizing the country for censorship and speech-based discrimination through regular reports and through presentations before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights [@a19:2009; @a19:2011]. In the case of Iran, which prohibits all speech that promotes homosexuality, all of Article 19's LGBT-focused advocacy occurs online only, and the organization makes no attempt to have a physical presence in the country.[^18] Laws focused on INGO programs keep Article 19 out of the country, but through regular contact with exiled activists and their prolific use of internet publishing (as seen in @fig:a19-me-reports, Iran receives the most published attention in the Middle East), the organization continues to engage in its mission of promoting freedom of expression. Article 19's diverse menu of programming enables it to creatively respond and adapt to regulations that restrict its in-country activities.

###  Drawing on programmatic flexibility to shape regulations

As Article 19 regularly notes, the rights of expression and assembly are deeply linked: "the defence of freedom of expression and access to information is essentially the defence of civic space" [@a19:2014, 8]. Because improvements to expression rights lead to improvements in assembly rights, one of Article 19's more unique responses to legal restrictions on civil society is to lobby the government for regulatory and statutory reforms in both expression and assembly, advancing "progressive interpretations of human rights laws that allow people to gather, speak, and seek information" [@a19:2014, 8] and "embed[ding] freedom of expression in the infrastructure of government" [@a19:2015, 31]. Article 19's litigation and consultation on issues of freedom of expression allow the organization to shape the legal environments of its target countries. This, in turn, has powerful knock-on effects: improving the legal environment in one country allows the organization to maintain its access throughout the region. 

Tunisia provides a prime example of this phenomenon. Article 19 began working in the country in 2005 as part of the Tunisia Monitoring Group (IFEX-TMG), a special eight-year endeavor organized by IFEX. Working with regional and international partners such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Index on Censorship, Freedom House, and the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, IFEX-TMG sent regular fact-finding and consulting missions to Tunisia, culminating in multiple reports outlining legislative recommendations to enhance media freedom, end censorship, and improve the rights of association, assembly, and movement [@ifex-tmg:2005; @ifex-tmg:2010]. Under President Ben Ali's rule, few of the recommendations had a chance of being implemented. However, following the president's overthrow during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Article 19 was ideally positioned to influence human rights policy in the country, and it opened a formal regional office in Tunis. Building on relationships established during IFEX-TMG missions, newly-elected Tunisian politicians solicited technical advice from Article 19 on issues related to freedom of expression and human rights more generally. The organization held workshops for legislators, offered regular comments on the nascent constitution, and worked with the president and party chairs to ensure that the legal environment for speech and assembly in the newly democratizing country would be safe and inviting [@a19:2012]. In January 2014, the country's National Constituent Assembly (NCA) adopted a new constitution that generally accorded with international human rights standards. Prominent politicians cited Article 19's assistance throughout the drafting process, including interim president Moncef Marzouki and NCA president Mustapha Ben Jafar [@a19:2014, 16].

The final post-revolutionary constitution was not perfect, and subsequent governments have continued to infringe on expression rights. However, secure in its legal status, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its work in Tunisia, issuing 87 advocacy letters and statements since the fall of Ben Ali in 2011 (see @fig:a19-me-reports), condemning government abuses, censorship, and arrests of journalists and activists. The organization's close connections with local politicians—as well as the more permissive legal environment for advocacy in general—allow Article 19 to continue its mission and litigate against the government.

Additionally, Article 19 has been able to use Tunisia as a regional home base. Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, and other Middle Eastern countries have all imposed strict gatekeeping regulations, either by preventing registration or by imposing rules that make human rights advocacy illegal. To get around these restrictions, Article 19 brings regional activists to its Tunisia office for training and research, rather than sending staff to those more restrictive countries.[^19] As a result, despite closed and dangerous civic space, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its post-Arab Spring advocacy, issuing reports and policy briefs to countries throughout the region (see @fig:a19-me-reports). Using its Tunisian office as a regional hub and tool for circumventing gatekeeping laws, however, is only possible because of the organization's programmatic flexibility. Collaboration with IFEX-TMG, politicians, and local NGOs in the years prior to the revolution, consistent government- and foundation-based funding, and highly trained staff allowed Article 19 to rapidly establish an office in 2011 and have positioned the organization to remain active in the region.

The laws impeding Article 19's work are generally designed to make operating an INGO abroad more difficult and costly. Article 19 has been able to adapt to these increasingly onerous gatekeeping regulations by relying on its large budget, its large menu of possible programs, its longstanding host government partnerships, and its network of regional offices. By drawing on these resources, the organization has been able to remain active in dozens of countries.
